## Project Proposal

### Abstract

The current approach to studying accreting black holes by considering only a few observations and only one data product at a time. This case-by-case approach is useful to study specific characteristics of the sources such as measuring the spin and mass of the black hole. However, this approach is insufficient to gain an understanding of the general phenomenology shown by accreting black holes. This project proposes the development of an interactive tool that systematically analyzes, stores, and organizes key data products from multiple observations. By enabling comprehensive visualization and comparison of X-ray spectral and timing properties over time, this tool will facilitate more efficient scientific decision-making and a deeper understanding of black hole evolution.


## Benefits to the Community

Currently, researchers analyze **only a few observations at a time**, limiting our understanding of the general behavior of black holes. This project will:

- Enable **large-scale classification and visualization** of X-ray observations.
- Provide a **single framework** to explore multiple data products (e.g., spectral and timing properties).
- **Speed up scientific decision-making** by allowing easy comparison across different telescopes.
- Allow researchers to **discover patterns** and classify observations using **machine learning (ML)**.

## Final Deliverables
- Analysis ready software packed with docker and also with manual installtion of Heasarc for more performance.

<!-- # Notes
the ability to visualize source behaviour over time across multiple metrics will guide our choices for which observations are best to make in future, as well as which observatories to use. It will also allow us to make quicker decisions on how to use the data that is already accessible for a given project<br> -->



## IMPLEMENTATION
### 1. Installtion of Required Packages
This Project requires the [Heasarc Software](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/lheasoft/download-go.html), we will first install the [Heasarc](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/lheasoft/download-go.html) software in isolated enviroment (To avoid confict with other software like CIAO or XMM-SAS) with  [hwrap script](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/lheasoft/hwrap.html) with required calibration files and geomagnetic quantities,Since the installation step are too complicated,we will document the installtion step (Pre GSOC).<br>
This is [instruction](link) that i wrote for the installtion of Heasarc Software.


### 1. **Fetch the X-ray observation data from archive**<br>
We will query the the observation data from Heasarc [FTP Website](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/nicer/data/obs/) by [Astroquery.Heasarc](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/heasarc/heasarc.html).

```python
from astroquery.heasarc import Heasarc
from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord

pos = SkyCoord.from_name('Cas A')
tab = Heasarc.query_region(pos, catalog='nicermastr')

tab = tab[tab['exposure'] > 0]
links = Heasarc.locate_data(tab[:3])
links['access_url'].pprint()
Heasarc.download_data(links=links[1:2]) # download the files in current folder
```

#### This is the UI for the Heasarc data petrieve pipeline.<br> 
The user inputs an object name, selects multiple missions, and fetches observational data. The retrieved data appears in a table in pop-up window, allowing the user to select multiple entries and download them simultaneously, and filter their desired data.
![Retrieve Data](assets/retrieve.png)<br>

### 2. Running the Heasarc Command with python
For the cleaning of observation files of various sources (eg. Nicer, NuSTAR), we need the HEASoft tools, which runs on bash. But
these commands also can be run in Python with [HEASoftpy](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/lheasoft/heasoftpy/). It provides python wrappers that call the HEASoft tools, allowing for easy integration into other python code.


```python
import heasoftpy as hsp
nicerl3 = hsp.HSPTask('nicerl3-spect')
nicerl3.clobber="yes"
nicerl3.geomag_path=paths.geomag_path
nicerl3(infile='5010080245')
```


<!-- ### 3. Pre-processing / Cleaning the Event files<br>
Processing the files before analysis is a crucial step in extracting useful data. -->

### 3. Nicer Data Processing Pipeline<br>
Processing the observation files before analysis is a crucial step in extracting useful insights data.<br>
Heasarc provide [streamlined steps](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer/analysis_threads/) for processing the Nicer observation files.<br>
<img src="assets/nicer_pipeline.png" alt="Nicer Data Processing Pipeline" width="500px" height="500px"><br>
Figure 1.This is Wokrflow showing nicerl3-spect and nicerl3-lc to make standard spectral and light curve products.<br>

Before starting the analysis, we need to clean the event file using `nicerl2`.This tool streamlines the standard pipeline processing of an observation by eliminating intermediate steps.

<!-- Bash<br>
```bash
cd /path/to/observation/data  # observation directory
nicerl2 indir=1234567890 clobber=YES 

# indir=1234567890 is name of observation directory
# clobber=YES means nicerl2 will overwrite existing filter files and higher level event files
``` -->

```python
import os
import heasoftpy as hsp
os.chdir('/path/to/observation/data')
nicerl2 = hsp.HSPTask('nicerl2')
nicerl2.clobber="yes"
nicerl2(infile='1234567890')
```

**The extraction of Spectrum** can be done from the observation file with [nicerl3-spect](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer/analysis_threads/nicerl3-spect/)

The `nicerl3-spect` task requires the output of the `nicerl2` task. The task will look in the supplied input directory name for the subdirectory xti/event_cl.

```python
import os
import heasoftpy as hsp
os.chdir('/path/to/observation/data')
nicerl3 = hsp.HSPTask('nicerl3-spect')
nicerl3.clobber="yes"
nicerl3(infile='1234567890')

```
Upon completion, nicerl3-spect will processed the `spectrum`, `ARF`, `RMF`, `SCORPEON background`, `background RMF`, `Sky ARF`, `"Load" file`, `Graphical output` products.


**Extraction of Power spectrum.**

```python
nicerl3_lc = hsp.HSPTask('nicerl3-lc')
nicerl3_lc.pirange = '300-1500'        # channel (energy) range 
nicerl3_lc.timebin=60.0                # time bin size in seconds 
nicerl3_lc.clobber='YES'
result = nicerl3_lc(indir = '7010080341')
print(result)
```
**Note**: There is more useful [resource](https://github.com/matteolucchini1/Chromie) that can be used for implementing this. Although this works well for data processing and extractions of spectrum(after bit of minor changes), but the visualization part doesn't seems to work, also this pipeline produces plots in pdf.
#### Analysis of the Observation Data

For the analysis of NICER observations, there are some of useful resources, [nicer-ixpe workshop](https://github.com/nmik/nicer-ixpe), [HEASARC-PyXspec notebooks](https://github.com/HEASARC/PyXspec-Jupyter-notebooks), which have various usefull notebooks explaining spectrum, light-curve, Spectral-Timing analysis by leveraging `Stingray`.
